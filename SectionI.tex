\paragraph*{Research Question:}
How can Areas of Mathematics Such as Exterior Algebra and Differential Topology be Applied in Order to Generalize the Integrals Found in Multivariate Calculus?\\

The integral is an essential piece of calculus, usually being taught after the derivative and before the infinite series in a first-year course on the subject. Its introduction will usually begin with computing the area under a function using Riemann sums, and then evaluating the limit of these sums as the number of rectangles approaches infinite. It is then generally understood that the integral of a function on a region is the area under the function on that region, and this idea extends nicely to higher dimensions \textemdash the double integral is a measure of area, the triple integral a measure of volume.
